                                    You are invited to take part in a research study about sleep, day time alertness, cognition and body clock. We are going to study sleep, body clock, day time alertness and cognition of participants that are older than 50 years with sleep disturbances. We will investigate if a simple intervention such as exposure to light will improve sleep, body clock, day time alertness, mood and mental activities.

                                    <h5 style='font-size:1.2rem;font-weight:bold'>Background</h5>
                                    The daily light and dark cycle is the strongest external time cue for humans to maintain circadian rhythmicity (keeping the body clock in time). Some individuals need brighter light for extended periods daily resetting their circadian rhythms and for maintaining daytime alertness. Interestingly, different light wavelengths (colour composition of the light) exert distinctive effects with bluish light increasing alertness and amber-red light promoting sleep.  
                                    <br><br>                                     
                                    Chronic dysregulation of circadian rhythms is usually accompanied by sleep disturbances which have major impacts on quality of life causing daytime fatigue, poor concentration, impaired mental activities, social isolation and worsening of health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity and premature death. Sleep disruption is mainly treated using pharmacological therapies but with limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. We propose to investigate whether Light Therapy (LT) of variable wavelengths can act as an alternative therapy to improve sleep quality, daytime alertness, circadian rhythmicity and cognitive function.

                                    Part 1 is a field-based study in your home and other living environments over 1 week and is open for any people aged 50 or older. You will be asked to wear two devices:

                                        A light sensor pin – a small, unobtrusive pin device, worn on your clothing designed to measure light exposure.

                                    At this visit you will also see a physician to conduct a routine medical and sleep assessment in order to rule out any conditions which may affect your eligibility for this study.  Following the sleep physician, you will be provided with a small wrist-worn device (Nonin WristOx 3150TM) which will be used to test for at-home obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) screening. You will simply attach the device to your wrist like a wristwatch and placing the probe over your finger. This will be worn overnight and sent back for analysis to the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research. We will also measure your height and weight

                                    If eligible, 1 week prior to your lab visit you will receive an actiwatch and a light-sensor pin to be worn for 7 days as you did during Part 1. You will also be asked to keep a sleep diary.

                                    During this visit you will stay in a suite at the Woolcock Institute and will be exposed to one of two light conditions during the daytime with all natural sunlight blocked out. On each day participants will be required to complete a battery of questionnaires and computer-based exercises regarding mood, alertness, cognitive abilities and sleepiness. We will also conduct multiple sleep studies during each day, and you will remain attached to the sleep study leads during the night for monitoring. In addition, on the third day your temperature will be measured every two hours during wake time and we will ask you to provide hourly saliva samples starting from 5 hours before habitual bedtime until bedtime.

                                    Furthermore, if you wish to provide an optional mucosa sample for research (a separate PIS and consent form will be provided to you) you will be asked to provide a mouth swab on day 1.

                                    After 2 weeks, we will ask you to come back to the Woolcock Institute to repeat most of the procedures but under the light you were not exposed to the first time (either light simulating daylight or control light) during day time. All tests and procedures will be the same as in visit 2 but you will not need to provide a mouth swab and questionnaires will not be needed to be filled out again.

Recording wrist movements over a period of a maximum of 1 week will help us assess your sleeping and physical activity. You will also fill out a sleep diary every day that you are wearing the actiwatch that will help us study your sleep patterns.  You will receive written and verbal instructions on how to use the actiwatch. <br>

                                            If the participant agrees to this component of the study, you will be asked to collect an oral mucosal sample using a painless swab technique. You will use a mouth swab (a small brush-like device) to rub the inside of your cheek for 60-90 seconds. These mucosa samples will be used to study a body clock gene (Per3) that may predict response to light treatment.

                                            During the laboratory study participants may undergo a routine sleep study, called polysomnography (PSG). The PSG involves trained technicians affixing a number of leads on your head to record your brain activity (EEG) and sensors on your body.  As part of your study, full video capture will be recorded and collected.

As part of your study, full video capture will be recorded and collected.

During the KDT you will be seated and quietly resting in a chair. You will be asked to look at a dot on the wall for approximately 2 minutes with your eyes open, followed by your eyes closed, and then with your eyes open again as instructed by the researcher. The test lasts 7.5 minutes in total.

You will also spend about 1 hour at the Woolcock Institute to receive a copy of this participant information sheet and have the study fully explained, to sign the consent form if you wish to take part in the study. You will also need to see a physician and undergo at-home screening.

Compensation may be available if your injury or complication is sufficiently serious and is caused by unsafe drugs or equipment, or by the negligence of one of the parties involved in the study (for example, the researcher, the hospital, or the treating Medical Practitioner).

Even small risks should be considered by you, as you do not need to take part in this research for the treatment of a medical condition. You need to balance this risk against your wish to be a part of the research project, before you consent to take part.
