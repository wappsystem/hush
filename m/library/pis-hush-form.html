                                    <b>Why am I being invited to participate?</b><br>
                                    You are being invited to take part because you may be experiencing subthreshold, mild or moderate insomnia. Chronic insomnia is highly prevalent in Australia and has broad implications on the emotional, social, and physical domains of health. It is characterised by difficulties with falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or an inability to return to sleep on waking occurring on at least three nights per week, for at least 3 months.

                                    <b>What is the purpose of this study?</b><br>
                                    This study aims to determine the effects of a low dose cannabis-based drug on sleep and health in 120 participants with chronic insomnia over a 12-week period. Cannabis is known to promote sleep and typically contains two main active ingredients, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC has some therapeutic actions and is primarily responsible for the intoxicating effects commonly associated with cannabis use. CBD has increasingly shown to have a wide range of therapeutic effects but is not intoxicating. This study uses CBD as the active ingredient and will provide much needed clinical data to understand CBDs position in insomnia therapy. You will not receive THC during this trial.

                                    <b>Who is undertaking the project?</b><br>
                                    This project is being conducted by Professor Iain McGregor, Professor Ron Grunstein, Associate Professor Brendon Yee, Proffesor Bandana Saini, Professor Andrew McLachlan, Associate Professor Ryan Vandrey, Associate Professor Nathaniel Marshall, Dr Jia Luo, Dr Danielle McCartney, Dr Janet Cheung, Dr Camilla Hoyos, Anastasia Suraev and Zeeta Bawa from the University of Sydney, the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research and the Johns Hopkins Bayview Behavioral Biology Research Centre.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For this study, we need male and female participants aged from 40 to 65 years old who are in good health; have subthreshold, mild and moderate insomnia experienced consistently for a period of at least 3 months; have not used cannabis or a CBD/medicinal cannabis product during the previous month; are proficient in English, have internet access, an active email account, are willing to comply with all study procedures and are available for the 12 week duration of the study.

                                    <br>
                                    Next, we will arrange a phone call with the clinical trial coordinator and a tele-health consultation with the study doctor to discuss your health in detail. We will also arrange for a blood tests, a drug screen, a pregnancy test (if female). If you are eligible to participate, you will be enrolled into the study. To ensure a fair test of our assumptions, we will assign you to one of two groups (active or placebo) on a 'chance' basis; you will have a 50% chance of being allocated to either.

                                    <br>
                                    The active group will receive CBD; while the the placebo group will receive a substance that does not contain CBD. The placebo looks identical to the active treatment and helps the researchers understand what effects are due to CBD. To avoid accidentally influencing the tests, neither you nor the researchers will know whether you receive the active or the placebo. However, if it is necessary for your care, this can be easily determined.

                                    The study will take place over a 12-week period. You will be required to undertake two comprehensive online questionnaires at the start and close of the study; complete five online fortnightly questionnaires and a sleep diary, wear an actigraphy watch, and take a daily supplement of the active or placebo treatment. Please see Figure 1. below for further details of the study timeline.

                                    This investigational product is not currently registered with the TGA or elsewhere outside Australia and is considered an experimental drug. Approval has not been given for this drug to treat chronic insomnia disorder or any other condition. Given the Therapeutic Goods of Australia’s assessment of the safety profile of low dose of low dose cannabidiol (1 mg/kg/day or ~60 mg/day) and alignment with the study’s comprehensive screening and exclusion criteria, the risks of serious adverse effects for participant in this study are thought to be minimal.

If at any time you think you may have become pregnant, it is important to let the researchers know immediately. If you are a male with a female partner, you should use reliable contraception (e.g. condoms) during the course of the study. If at any time you think your sexual partner may have become pregnant, it is important to let the researchers know immediately.

All data will either be stored in password-protected files on a secure server maintained by the University of Sydney known as Research Data Store (RDS) that is regularly backed, or as paper-based documents that will be securely locked in a filing cabinet at the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics. No personal information about you, such as your name and address will leave the clinic, and trial information sent out from the clinic will identify you with a code number only.

We will arrange a clinical follow-up appointment with your physician if deemed necessary by the study doctor. Please be aware that the study treatment will not be made available to you after the research project ends. Any published results will be available to all participants when requested. It is usual for a number of months to elapse before definitive results of this type of study are available. These will be published in a de-identified manner in medical journals that are available to the public. You should feel free to ask the study staff about this.
